don't pray for it to rain,
don't look to the sky
hold me with your lonesome eyes
you slipped into my room
in a simple disguise
take me with your furtive eyes
i want...i wait
for time to come my way again
stay here, your sorrow's
luring me in,
but does this sorrow ever end?
sadness invites me,
entices me to you
don't let me go
you first came to me with misery
but now you feel uninspiring
all the pain in your face
has been replaced
i'm so tired of useless
words and laughing
with you i felt
time lift and carry me away
i want you with me
but all you feel is cold
is this getting old?
your look of sorrow,
it fills me with desire
my heart's on fire
＜♪＞
come here, come near me
there is no one like you
let's burn up this room
now that i'm with you,
i see it day by day
facades, they fade away
how will you get by?
you know, i just don't care
for foolish affairs
you cheat, you smile,
you laugh at my desire
i'm crazy for...
what am i crazy for?
